# modular-exponentiation
Just uses a basic tkinter GUI to take inputs and spit out an output. 
Inputs : Base, Exponent and Modulus  
Ouputs : The remainder when Base^Exponent is divided by Modulus  
How to run : There are two files in this repo, [mod_exp.py](https://github.com/yakeen15/modular-exponentiation/blob/main/mod_exp.py) is the file that has the algorithm for the modular exponentiation, and [modexp_tkinter.py](https://github.com/yakeen15/modular-exponentiation/blob/main/modexp_tkinter.py) is the tkinter interface that accepts and prints the inputs and outputs, respectively. The only dependency is tkinter, meaning you would need tkinter installed on your device to run the program.
